      Tracer is a trustless protocol for creating and trading 
      financial derivatives. Using TCR, Tracer's governance token, 
      users can vote and control the smart contracts powering Tracer.
      In this dashboard, we'll explore the distribution of Tracer's 
      governance token to users as rewards. By participating in 
      Tracer's Perpetual Pools, users can earn TCR rewards. 
      TCR is also distributed to governors, investors, and teams via
      vesting contracts.

      The TCR token has a maximum supply of 1,000,000,000. 
      It was initially distributed on the 8th September, 2021. 


      The Tracer DAO treasury was allocated 64.04% of the supply, 
      but TCR rewards aren't being dispensed from this contract currently.


      Instead, 'claim' transactions are coming out of The 100 Vesting contract 
      and 52 Governors Vesting contract.`,

      User claims seem to start in the last part of Q2 2021, with the most TCR
      claimed in one day (to date) on Oct 23rd 2021 - over 2.7M TCR tokens. 
              
      Before Q2 2021, we see a few 'claimTokens' transactions in Jan 2021 (see first
      graph) that may be administrative transactions or constitute a different type
      of claim.

          To find user TCR reward claims, ethereum.udm_events was filtered for the
          TCR contract address (0x9C4A4204B79dd291D6b6571C5BE8BbcD0622F050). The
          ORIGIN_FUNCTION_NAME column was used to filter for 'claim' or
